\begin{abstract}
  A data analysis is said to \emph{generalize} when it allows one to draw
  conclusions from the data that are true of the population from which
  the data are sampled. Statistician and data scientist have devised
  several methods aimed to guarantee generalization in  data
  analyses, and avoid in this way overfitting to the
  data. Guaranteeing generalization is more difficult when data
  analyses are \emph{adaptive}: when the result of an analysis depends
  on the result of previous analyses. 

  A recent line of work focuses on methods aimed at guaranteeing
  generalization in adaptive data analysis through the addition of
  carefully calibrated statistical noise to the empirical results of
  the analysis on the sampled data. In these works, the confidence
  intervals on the generalization error that one can achieve for a
  given analysis usually depend on the \emph{level of adaptivity} of
  the analysis: the number of adaptive steps that depend the one on
  the other. 

  In this work we introduce a programming framework, named \THESYSTEM,  aimed at
  supporting the study of the generalization error for adaptive data
  analysis. The main component \THESYSTEM~is a type-and-effect system
  using effects to track the level of adaptivity of a given
  program. Using a trace-based operational semantics and an effect-enriched
  logical relation we show this analysis sound. We propose a
  bidirectional type-checking algorithm which allows us to implement
  the type-and-effect system in an algorithmic way.  Finally, we show how
  to use \THESYSTEM~to estimate confidence intervals on the
  generalization error of different examples.
