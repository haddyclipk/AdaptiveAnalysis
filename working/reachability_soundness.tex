  \begin{thm}[Soundness of the Reachability Analysis]
    \label{thm:reachability_soundness}
  Given a program ${c}$, we have:
  %
  \[
  \forall x^l \in \lvar_c \st 
  \max \left\{ \vcounter(\vtrace') l ~ \middle\vert~
  \forall \vtrace \in \mathcal{T} \st \config{{c}, \trace} \to^{*} \config{\eskip, \trace\tracecat\vtrace'} \right\} 
  \leq 
  \rb(x^l, c)
  \]
  \end{thm}
}
Proof Summary:
\\
1. Translating of each command estimate the upper bound of the change of each variable showing up in the guard of the while command, in each iteration.
\\
2. Composition of sequence either preserve the latest update of the variable, or compose it with variables flows to it.
\\
3. Composition of if preserve the variable upper bound in both of the 2 branches.
\\
4. Composition of a nested $\ewhile$ multiples the variable change upper bound by the bound of the nested while loop, which safely estimated the variable upper bound for the outside while loop.
\\
5. Ranking function matches the pattern for every possibility and Give the max upper bound of changes for variable showing up inside the guard of the while.
\\
6. By estimating the changes for all the variables in the boolean expression of the guard of the while in 1 iteration, computeBound divides the n by the changes of the boolean expression is the safe upper bound of how many times this while can looped.
