\subsection{Trace-based Adaptivity}
Given a program $c$ with a database $D$, we generate its program-based graph 
$\traceG(\ssa{c}, D) = (\vertxs, \edges, \weights, \qflag)$.
%
Then the adaptivity bound based on program analysis for $\ssa{c}$ is the number of query vertices on a finite walk in $\progG(\ssa{c})$. This finite walk satisfies:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item the number of query vertices on this walk is maximum
\item the visiting times of each vertex $v$ on this walk is bound by its weight $\weights(v)$.
\end{itemize}
%
It is formally defined in \ref{def:trace_adapt}.
%
\begin{defn}
[Adaptivity of A Program].
\label{def:trace_adapt}
\\
Given a program $\ssa{c}$ in SSA language, 
its adaptivity is defined for all possible starting SSA memory $\ssa{m}$ and database $D$ as follows:
%
$$
A(c) = \max \big 
\{ \qlen(k) \mid D \in \dbdom , k \in \walks(\traceG(c, D) \big \} 
$$
\end{defn}
%

\todo{
The following lemma describes a property of the trace-based dependency graph.
For any program $c$ with a database $D$ and a starting memory $m$,
the directed edges in its trace-based dependency graph can only be constructed from nodes representing 
smaller annotated queries to annotated queries of greater order.
There doesn't exist backward edges with direction from greater annotated queries to smaller ones.

Given a program $c$, a database $D$, a starting memory $m$ and the corresponding trace-based dependency graph $G(c,D) = (\vertxs, \edges)$, 
for any directed edge $(\event', \event) \in \edges$, 
this is not the case that:
%
$$\event' \eventgeq \event$$

Given the program $c$ with a certain database $D$ and starting memory $m$, the $A(c)$ w.r.t. the $D$ and $m$ is bounded, i.e.,:
%
\[
\config{m, c, [], []} 
\rightarrow^{*} 
\config{m', \eskip, t', w'} 
\implies
A_{D, m}(c) \leq |t'|
