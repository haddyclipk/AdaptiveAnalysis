\begin{thm}[Soundness of $\pathsearch$]
  \label{thm:sound_adaptalg}
  For every program $c$, given its \emph{Program-Based Dependency Graph} $\progG$,
   $$\pathsearch(\progG) \geq \progA(\progG).$$
\end{thm}
proof Summary:
1. for each SCC, a subgraph of $\progG$, $\pathsearch_{scc}(SCC) \geq \progA(SCC)$
2. for every two nodes with a path $x, \cdots, y$, let $\walks(k_{x,y})$ be all the walks from $x$ to $y$ on $\progG$,
then $adapt[SCC(x)] + \cdots + adapt[SCC(y)] \geq \max\{\qlen(k)\}$
